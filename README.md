## Introduction

Yahtzee is a game where the player rolls five dice up to three times per turn to achieve specific scoring combinations, like three-of-a-kind, full house, a straight, or a Yahtzee (five of a kind). 

The goal is to maximize the total score by strategically choosing combinations across 13 rounds.

The game can be played here: [yhtz.fr](https://yhtz.fr)
